# barebones

barebones is a static project starter built from the ground up. My goal is to only include the packages and functionality I need, when I need it.

## Features

* [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) - [Tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-browsersync-for-faster-development)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

## How-To

To start a new project by cloning this repository:

```
git clone 'https://github.com/ryanabest/barebones'
```

Once you rename the 'barebones' folder to your project name, cd to that folder then run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This final command will open a server in your browser that hosts your project (available at localhost:3000). Your browser will now watch for any changes you make and automatically incorporate these changes once they are saved.

## Next Additions

* [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) to add some naming convention automation.
